# Relic Tracker

A Discord bot build for the official [Phantom Abyss server](https://discord.gg/phantomabyss) that tracks missing relics per member and notifies them if one of their missing relics is found.

### Commands

The bot uses slash commands which are a built-in Discord feature. There are no manual text commands.

1. `/relics`  
List all of your tracked relics.
2. `/needrelic [tier] [number]`  
Track a relic you are looking for. You will be pinged if it is found.
3. `/foundrelic [tier] [number]`  
Stop tracking a relic you are no longer looking for.
4. `/sharerelic [tier] [number] [sharecode]`  
Provide the sharecode for a relic you found that others might need.
